# ie_store

This a discrete math project. We were asked to build an ER diagram for our final project.

We decided that once we had finished with the theoretical side of this project, we also wanted to implemented in a practical way.

Our ER diagram was simulating an ecommerce platform database. Therefore, we decided to simulate an merchandising store for our current university.
